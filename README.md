# Sketch Pad

This website presents an interactive space where we can draw anything in pixel style.
Sketch Pad offers the possibility to change the size of the grid and select from a variety of color choices and dispositions.

## Goal

The main goal of this project is to practice DOM manipulation and improve the code I produce.
